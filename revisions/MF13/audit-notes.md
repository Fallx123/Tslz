## File-by-File Audit

### TypeScript (Nous Server)

**1. `db.ts` — PASS**
- `clusters` table: all 8 columns match guide spec exactly
- `cluster_memberships` table: all 5 columns + composite PK match exactly
- No FOREIGN KEY constraints (correct per guide decision)
- Minor placement deviation: tables placed after `safeAddColumn` calls instead of before (guide step 1 says "before the first `safeAddColumn` call"). Non-functional — CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS is idempotent.

**2. `utils.ts` — PASS**
- `clusterId()` generates `cl_` + 12 char nanoid. Correct.
- Style changed from arrow functions to named function exports with JSDoc. Non-functional deviation from guide. Internally consistent.

**3. `clusters.ts` (NEW) — PASS**
- All 9 route handlers present and match guide code
- `parseAutoSubtypes` helper correctly parses JSON→array with spread copy (no mutation of original row)
- POST returns 201, errors return 400/404
- DELETE cascades memberships before cluster
- Member add uses INSERT OR IGNORE for idempotency
- Health computes lifecycle counts with proper null handling
- Member list applies FSRS decay via `applyDecay()`

**4. `index.ts` — PASS**
- Import added at line 14, mount at line 33 (last). Matches guide.

**5. `ssa-context.ts` — PASS**
- `createSSAContext` accepts optional `{ includeClusterData?: boolean }`
- Conditional cluster JOIN with `GROUP_CONCAT(cm.cluster_id)` when enabled
- Standard path unchanged when disabled (zero overhead)
- Returns `clusters: string[]` which matches `FilterNodeInput` type

**6. `search.ts` — PASS**
- `cluster_ids` destructured from body
- `hasClusterFilter` computed correctly
- Cluster-aware SSA context created conditionally
- `clusters` filter passed to SSA request
- Fallback LIKE search correctly omits cluster filter (by design)

**7. `nodes.ts` — PASS**
- DELETE handler adds `DELETE FROM cluster_memberships WHERE node_id = ?` before node deletion
- Matches guide step 12 exactly

### Python (Hynous)

**8. `client.py` — PASS**
- `search()` signature updated with `cluster_ids: list[str] | None = None`
- Payload includes `cluster_ids` when provided
- All 9 cluster methods present and match guide code exactly
- Methods follow existing NousClient pattern: `self._session.[method](self._url(...))` → `raise_for_status()` → `return resp.json()`
- `list_clusters` and `get_cluster_members` handle both dict-wrapped and raw responses

**9. `clusters.py` (NEW) — PASS**
- `TOOL_DEF` with 8 actions, 10 properties. Matches guide.
- `_SUBTYPE_MAP` covers all 12 subtypes (matches `_TYPE_MAP` in memory.py)
- `_normalize_subtypes` handles: short name → full, already-prefixed → passthrough, unknown → fallback `custom:` prefix
- `handle_manage_clusters` covers all 8 action branches with proper validation
- `register()` follows standard pattern
- All output formatting strips `custom:` prefix for readability

**10. `registry.py` — PASS**
- `from . import clusters; clusters.register(registry)` added after conflicts. Matches guide.

**11. `memory.py` — PASS**
- `cluster` param added to `STORE_TOOL_DEF`, `handle_store_memory`, `_store_memory_impl`
- `cluster` param added to `RECALL_TOOL_DEF`, `handle_recall_memory`
- Queue mode includes `cluster` in kwargs dict
- Queue result message shows `[→ cluster: ...]` when cluster specified
- Stored result message shows `[→ cluster: ...]` when cluster specified
- Explicit cluster assignment is synchronous (agent gets feedback)
- Auto-assignment runs in daemon thread (non-blocking)
- `_auto_assign_clusters` handles: JSON string auto_subtypes, parsed list auto_subtypes, empty/null auto_subtypes, Nous being down
- `exclude_cluster` prevents duplicate assignment when explicit + auto overlap
- `cluster_ids=[cluster] if cluster else None` passed to `client.search()` in recall. Correct.
- Dedup path: if duplicate found → no cluster assignment (node not created). Correct.

### Documentation

**12. `more-functionality.md` — PASS (minor)**
- MF-13 section header marked `~~DONE~~` with comprehensive status summary
- P3 note: implementation order table at bottom (line 492) is NOT marked as done — inconsistent with section header

**13. `nous/README.md` — PASS (minor)**
- All 9 cluster methods added to NousClient table with correct endpoints and "Used By" info
- P3 note: line 111 still says "Remaining integration work: search-before-store dedup (MF-0)" — MF-0 is already DONE. Pre-existing stale text, not MF-13.

**14. `tools/README.md` — PASS**
- Tool count updated to 17. `clusters.py` listed as tool #17.

**15. `intelligence/README.md` — PASS**
- Tool count updated to 17. `clusters.py` in directory tree.

## Issues Found

### P0 (Critical)
None.

### P1 (High)
None.

### P2 (Medium)
None.

### P3 (Low / Informational)

**P3-1: INSERT OR IGNORE counter is misleading** (clusters.ts:345-355)
The `added` counter in POST /clusters/:id/members increments on every loop iteration, even when INSERT OR IGNORE silently skips a duplicate. The API returns `added: 1` on re-add even though no row was created. The guide explicitly acknowledges this behavior ("returns `added: 1` but no duplicate row"). Not a data integrity issue — just misleading feedback.

**P3-2: No index on `cluster_memberships.node_id`** (db.ts)
The composite PK `(cluster_id, node_id)` creates an index useful for cluster-based lookups but not for `WHERE node_id = ?` queries (used in node deletion cleanup in nodes.ts). For current scale this is fine. Consider adding `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_cm_node_id ON cluster_memberships (node_id)` if the table grows large.

**P3-3: Documentation table not updated** (more-functionality.md:492)
The implementation order table at the bottom of `more-functionality.md` still shows MF-13 as `| **Phase 3** | MF-13 (Clusters) | 4-6 hrs |` without strikethrough, while the section header is correctly marked DONE.

**P3-4: Pre-existing stale text in nous/README.md** (line 111)
"Remaining integration work: search-before-store dedup (MF-0)" — MF-0 has been DONE since before this MF. Not caused by MF-13.

**P3-5: PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON but cluster tables use manual cascade** (db.ts:24)
The db.ts enables `PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON` (line 24) and the edges table uses `REFERENCES nodes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`. The cluster tables don't use FK constraints, relying on manual cascade in route handlers instead. This means direct SQLite deletion of a cluster or node outside the API would leave orphaned cluster_memberships rows (while edges would cascade-clean). This is an intentional guide decision but creates a consistency gap with the edges table approach.

---

## Pre-Existing Issues (Not MF-13)

1. **Core build fails** — `pnpm build` in `nous-server/` fails due to missing `./storage` module referenced in `core/src/index.ts` line 36. The server works fine because it imports specific submodules, not the barrel export.

2. **Core dist files deleted** — Git status shows all `core/dist/*.d.ts` files deleted and duplicate `"index 2.js"` files in dist subdirectories. Restored from git for testing. Should be rebuilt.

3. **Type error in nodes.ts:413** — `result.rows[i]!.id` has `Value | undefined` type mismatch in the backfill-embeddings route. Pre-existing, not MF-13.

---

## Summary

The MF-13 implementation is production-ready. The engineer executed the guide faithfully — all 15 files match the specification with only cosmetic deviations (function style in utils.ts, table placement order in db.ts). The 40 E2E tests confirm all cluster CRUD operations, membership management, cascade deletion, multi-cluster support, cluster-scoped search (verified with real OpenAI embeddings), health reporting, error handling, and regression compatibility work correctly.

Cluster-scoped search verified end-to-end: 3 nodes with embeddings, unscoped search returns all 3, cluster-scoped search correctly filters to only the 2 cluster members (QQQ signal node excluded). SSA seed counts confirm the filter operates at the seeding level, not just post-filtering.

No changes required from the engineer. The P3 items are informational observations, not bugs.
