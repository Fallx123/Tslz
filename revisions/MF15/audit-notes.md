## File-by-File Audit

### Python (Hynous)

**1. `gate_filter.py` (NEW) — PASS**
- All 6 rules implemented (R-001, R-002, R-003, R-004, R-005, R-006, R-008). R-007 skipped per guide.
- `MIN_CONTENT_LENGTH = 10` (adjusted from TypeScript's 3). Correct.
- `GateResult` dataclass with `frozen=True`. Correct.
- `check_content()` normalizes whitespace, runs rules in correct order (001→002→003→004→005→006→008), returns `_PASS` singleton on pass. Correct.
- `_is_gibberish()` requires BOTH high entropy AND low word ratio. Correct.
- `_shannon_entropy()` matches TypeScript `calculateEntropy()` exactly. Returns 0.0 for empty string.
- `_matches_spam()` uses `.search()` (not `.match()`) — catches spam anywhere in text. Correct.
- `_is_social_only()` uses `.match()` (anchored to start) — only catches pure social messages. Correct.
- FILLER_WORDS: 16 words, matches TypeScript exactly.
- COMMON_WORDS: 110 words, matches TypeScript exactly.
- SPAM_PATTERNS: 5 patterns, matches TypeScript exactly.
- SOCIAL_PATTERNS: 8 English patterns, matches TypeScript `en` array exactly.
- `_EMOJI_PUNCT_WS_RE`: Uses explicit Unicode ranges (documented approximation — Python `re` doesn't support `\p{}`). Functional for the Hynous use case.
- Zero external dependencies (only stdlib).

**2. `memory.py` — PASS**
- Gate check inserted at top of `_store_memory_impl()` (lines 385-401).
- Imports `load_config` and `check_content` inside the function body (lines 385-386) — consistent with existing codebase pattern of local imports.
- Loads config, checks `cfg.memory.gate_filter_enabled`, calls `check_content(content)`. Correct.
- On reject: logs rejection, returns `"Not stored: {detail}"`. Correct format (distinct from "Stored:", "Queued:", "Duplicate:").
- `get_client()` moved to line 403-404 — AFTER the gate check. No wasted Nous connection on rejected content. This is an improvement over the guide: the engineer also moved the `from ...nous.client import get_client` import below the gate check (guide only specified moving the call).
- No gate check in `handle_store_memory()`. Correct.
- Dedup check still runs after gate passes. Correct.
- Queue flush (`flush_memory_queue()`) still calls `_store_memory_impl()` — gate runs on queued items at flush time. Correct per guide.

**3. `config.py` — PASS**
- `gate_filter_enabled: bool = True` added to `MemoryConfig` at line 64. Correct.
- `load_config()` builder wires `gate_filter_enabled=mem_raw.get("gate_filter_enabled", True)` at line 178. Correct.

**4. `test_gate_filter.py` (NEW) — PASS**
- 50 tests covering all 6 rejection rules, 3 helper function tests, 3 GateResult tests.
- Smart test adjustments: uses "testtesttesting" (15 chars) instead of "testtest" (8 chars) to avoid R-001 triggering before target rule.
- Uses "How are you?" (12 chars) for social_only test instead of "Hello!" (6 chars) which would hit R-001 first.
- Uses 10 different emojis for R-006 test instead of 4 identical ones which would hit R-003's repeated pattern.
- Tests verify R-004 can be caught by either spam_pattern or repeated_chars — acknowledging that R-003's `(.{1,3})\1{5,}` pattern may catch single-char repeats before R-004's `(.)\1{10,}`.

**5. `test_gate_filter_integration.py` (NEW) — PASS**
- 7 tests covering: reject-short, reject-spam, reject-social, pass-good, gate-disabled, reject-filler, episode-type-also-gated.
- Patches at source modules (`hynous.core.config.load_config`, `hynous.nous.client.get_client`) — correct approach for local function-body imports.
- Verifies `mock_get_client.assert_not_called()` on rejection — confirms no Nous connection is made.
- Includes test for `gate_filter_enabled=False` allowing junk through. Correct.

**6. `tests/unit/__init__.py` (NEW) — PASS**
- Empty init file for test discovery. Not in guide but necessary.

**7. `tests/integration/__init__.py` (NEW) — PASS**
- Empty init file for test discovery. Not in guide but necessary.

### Documentation

**8. `more-functionality.md` — PASS**
- MF-15 section header marked `~~MF-15. [P3] Gate Filter for Memory Quality~~ DONE`. Correct.
- Implementation summary added with module path, test paths, and description. Correct.
- MF-14 section marked `~~MF-14. [P3] Edge Decay and Pruning~~ SKIPPED` with rationale. Correct.
- Implementation order table updated: MF-14 = ~~SKIPPED~~, MF-15 = ~~DONE~~. All items in table now resolved.

**9. `executive-summary.md` — PASS**
- Companion files table updated: `14 DONE, 2 SKIPPED (MF-11, MF-14), 0 remaining`. Correct count.

**10. `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/README.md` — PASS (minor)**
- Pre-existing changes from prior MFs (architecture diagram fix, revision docs section added). Not MF-15 specific but bundled in the same working tree. No issues.

## Issues Found

### P0 (Critical)
None.

### P1 (High)
None.

### P2 (Medium)
None.

### P3 (Low / Informational)

**P3-1: Pre-existing editable install issue**
Tests fail with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'hynous'` without explicit `PYTHONPATH=/path/to/src`. The `.pth` file (`_hynous.pth`) exists in site-packages and points to the correct `src/` directory, but Python doesn't pick it up. This is a pre-existing issue — not caused by MF-15. Tests pass with `PYTHONPATH` set. The engineer should add a note or `conftest.py` sys.path fix for future test runners.

**P3-2: `__init__.py` files not in guide**
The engineer created `tests/unit/__init__.py` and `tests/integration/__init__.py` which are needed for test discovery but weren't listed in the guide's file summary. Not a problem — correct pragmatic addition.

**P3-3: R-004/R-003 overlap on single-char repeats**
R-003's spam pattern `(.{1,3})\1{5,}` catches single-character repeats (e.g., "aaaaaaaaaaaa" = 12 a's = group "a" repeated 12 times) before R-004's `(.)\1{10,}` gets a chance. The engineer's test acknowledges this by asserting `result.reason in ("spam_pattern", "repeated_chars")` for the "greaaaaaaaaaaat" case. Functionally correct — content is still rejected. The same overlap exists in TypeScript.

**P3-4: Unicode emoji regex approximation**
The `_EMOJI_PUNCT_WS_RE` regex uses explicit Unicode ranges instead of `\p{Emoji}` (which requires the `regex` package). This may miss some Unicode punctuation or rare emoji not in the listed ranges. For the Hynous use case (English-only equities/options trading agent), this is acceptable. The guide explicitly documents this trade-off.

---

## Pre-Existing Issues (Not MF-15)

1. **Editable install broken** — `pip install -e .` creates `.pth` file but Python doesn't resolve it. Tests need `PYTHONPATH` workaround.

2. **ARCHITECTURE.md / README.md / docs/README.md changes** — These diffs are from prior MF work bundled in the same working tree. Not MF-15 related.

3. **trading.py / watchpoints.py / memory_manager.py changes** — These diffs are from prior MF work (MF-1 Hebbian strengthening, NW wiring fixes). Confirmed: no gate filter logic added to these files. The `create_node()` paths in these files remain ungated, as specified.

---

## Summary

The MF-15 implementation is production-ready. The engineer executed the guide faithfully — all constants match the TypeScript reference exactly (16 filler words, 110 common words, 5 spam patterns, 8 social patterns), all thresholds match (entropy 4.5, word ratio 0.3, filler 0.9, min content 10), and the integration is correct (gate only in `_store_memory_impl()`, before dedup, before `get_client()`).

The engineer made one improvement over the guide: moving the `get_client` import (not just the function call) below the gate check, avoiding even the module import on rejected content. This is a minor optimization that doesn't affect behavior.

57 automated tests cover all 6 rejection rules, helper functions, the GateResult dataclass, and the integration with `_store_memory_impl()`. Manual verification confirmed no false positives on representative equities trading content and correct behavior on all edge cases.

No changes required from the engineer. The P3 items are informational observations, not bugs.
