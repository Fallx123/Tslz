Web Search Tool

Real-time web search via Perplexity Sonar API.
Gives the agent access to news, macro events, regulatory changes, and knowledge gaps.

This is a "break glass in case of emergency" tool — NOT for compulsive news checking.

Good use cases:
  - Something weird happened (flash crash, unexplained move, earnings surprise)
  - Cross-checking a thesis ("Is there actually Fed news today?")
  - Understanding macro/regulatory shifts that change the game
  - Filling a specific knowledge gap ("How do rate cuts typically impact growth stocks?")
  - Learning trading concepts to sharpen analysis

Bad use cases:
  - "Let me search for stock price predictions" — useless
  - Reading analyst opinions to validate bias
  - Checking news before every trade
  - Anything the data tools already answer better

The agent's own words: "The data tools ARE the news, in objective form.
Money flow doesn't lie. News does."

Standard tool module pattern:
  1. TOOL_DEF — Anthropic JSON schema
  2. handler  — processes the tool call
  3. register — wires into the registry
